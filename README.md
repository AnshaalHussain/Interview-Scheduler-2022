## Introduction

The primary goal of Interview Scheduler is to provide users with the ability to schedule appointments by selecting their preferred day, time, and interviewer. 

The application ensures a seamless experience by dynamically updating and presenting the available spots for each day. Whether users are creating, editing, or deleting appointments, the application responds in real-time to reflect the accurate number of remaining spots for a given day. This functionality allows users to make informed decisions while scheduling appointments and helps them easily identify available time slots.
